Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimidine (AT-21-1)

A solution of AT-6 (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 3-(4'-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.052 g, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.019 g, 0.026 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (10 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia).
Maybe triturating with methanol will purify this.

AT-21-1-MeOD.pdf
In MeOD. Impurities sufficiently soluble, i.e. product insoluble, isolated material is impure.




AT-21-1-MeOD-DMSO.pdf
In MeOD, with the addition of several drops of DMSO-d6. Product much more soluble.




AT-21-1-DMSO-afterMeOH.pdf
In DMSO-d6, after washing with methanol. Looks good!
