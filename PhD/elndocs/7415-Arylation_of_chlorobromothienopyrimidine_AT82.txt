Arylation of chlorobromothienopyrimidine (AT-8-2)
3rd May 2013 @ 01:22


Repeat of AT-8-1, with preferential formation of the arylated product at the bromo-position, rather than the diarylated product. Reaction mixture diluted by half, catalyst loading lowered by half, slight excess of boronic acid.  


To a solution of isopropanol (10 mL) and potassium carbonate (0.802 mL, 1 M, 2.0 equiv.) degassed with argon, was added AT-5 (0.100 g, 0.40 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), phenylboronic acid (0.054 g, 0.44 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.029 g, 0.04 mmol, 0.1 equiv.) and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (50 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (6:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give three compounds.
