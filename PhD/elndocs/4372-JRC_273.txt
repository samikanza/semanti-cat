4-Chlorothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (913.7 mg, 5.355 mmol, 1 equiv.) was dried and dissolved in dry THF (20 mL). This solution was stirred at -78 °C for 10 min before n-butyllithium solution (2.5 M in hexane, 2.2 mL, 5.5 mmol, 1.02 equiv.) was added dropwise. The solution became darker in colour. This solution was stirred at -78 °C for 30 min before elemental bromine (0.3 mL, 5.82 mmol, 1.08 equiv.) was added dropwise. This reaction was stirred at rt for 2 hr before the reaction was quenched by the addition of water (5 mL). The reaction solution was extracted wtih ethyl acetate (100 mL) and water (40 mL). The soluton was washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution until the orange colour disappeared. The organic layer was washed with water (2 x 50 mL) and brine (30 mL) before being dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The residue was concentrated in vacuo to yield an orange solid, which was recrystallised from 50% EtOH/H2O with drops of acetone to yield a pale off-white paste (708.4 mg, 2.839 mmol, 53%) which 1H-NMR revealed to be the desired product.
