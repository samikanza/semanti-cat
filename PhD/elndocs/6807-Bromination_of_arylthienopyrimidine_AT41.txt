Bromination of arylthienopyrimidine (AT-4-1)

Bromination of arylthienopyrimidine (AT-2), according to standard bromination conditions. 


 
To AT-2 (0.100 g, 0.47 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in THF (10 mL) at -78 C was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 0.208 mL, 0.52 mmol, 1.1. equiv.) dropwise with stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at -78 C for 30 minutes, after which bromine (0.302 g, 0.097 mL, 1.89 mmol, 4.0 equiv.) was added dropwise. The reaction was warmed to rt, stirred, with monitoring by TLC.  
Accidental addition of excess (approx. 2 equiv.) n-BuLi. As a result, the reaction mixture was only stirred for 5 minutes before the addition of bromine. 
The reaction was judged to be complete (complete disappearance of starting material) after 15 minutes; the reaction mixture was quenced with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (10 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted into ethyl acetate (2 x 10 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with water (20 mL), brine (20mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. 
Analysis of the crude reaction mixture by TLC showed the presence of four new compounds. Purification by flash column chromatography (7:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) gave (in order of increasing polarity):
Fraction 1: 0.057 g, insoluble (after evaporation of eluting solvent) yellow solid


Fraction 2: 0.011 g, unidentified yellow oil, 1H NMR showed the presence of butyl groups


Fraction 3: 0.030 g, dibrominated substrate AT-4b (17%)


Fraction 4: 0.078 g, monobrominated substrate AT-4a (57%)
