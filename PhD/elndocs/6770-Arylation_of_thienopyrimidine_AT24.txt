To AT-1-1 (0.050 g, 0.29 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), phenylboronic acid (0.045 g, 0.37 mmol, 1.25 equiv.) and cesium carbonate (0.144 g, 0.44 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) under argon was added Pd(PPh3)4 (0.017 g, 0.015 mmol, 0.05 equiv.). Toluene (3 mL) and ethanol (0.5 mL) were added and the reaction mixture degassed. The reaction mixture was stirred under argon at 80 C. 
Reaction complete (i.e. complete disappearance of starting material) after 4 h; reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with water (10 mL) and extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (2:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate).
