7th May 2013 @ 11:16


Repeat of AT-26-1.


To a solution of isopropanol (4 mL) and potassium carbonate (0.24 mL, 1 M, 0.24 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) degassed with argon was added AT-5 (0.030 g 0.12 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 4-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.037 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.0088 g, 0.012 mmol, 0.1 equiv.) and the reaction mixture heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (50 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia).
