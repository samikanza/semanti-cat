Arylation of AT-6 with 3-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester, under the conditions described in AT-7-1.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.173 mL, 0.173 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and 3-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture degassed for a further 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.011 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and filtered through Celite. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:ammonia:methanol) to give the assumed product at RF = 0.2 as a brown oil (0.005 g, 25%),

1H NMR spectrum of isolated material. Spectrum has signals representing the product in the expected regions, but is not overly convincing for the isolated material to be the product AT-11.
This may be due to the coupling partner (pinacol boronic ester, rather than the boronic acid).
