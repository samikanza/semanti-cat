Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimidine (AT-15-2)

 Re-attempting this one.


 
A solution of AT-6 (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), benzylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.034 uL, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.019 g, 0.026 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes.
No transformation! Fluoro group too electron-withdrawing? Not sure. Not to worry.
