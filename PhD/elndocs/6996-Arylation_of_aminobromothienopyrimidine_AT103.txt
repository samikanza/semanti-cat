Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimidine (AT-10-3)
16th March 2013 @ 05:18


Attempted arylation of AT-6 with 4-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester using sodium tert-butoxide (4.0 equiv.) as base and toluene as solvent. 


To degassed toluene (1 mL) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 4-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.027 g, 0.097 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and sodium tert-butoxide (0.033 g, 0.35 mmol, 4.0 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.013 g, 0.018 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at reflux overnight. 
 
No reaction - quantitative recovery of starting material.
