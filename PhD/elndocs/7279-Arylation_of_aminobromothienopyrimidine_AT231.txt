A solution of AT-6 (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 4-amidophenyl boronic acid (0.026 g, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.019 g, 0.026 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes.
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (10 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia).

Not the desired product. Hm. Not to say that the reaction was not successful, maybe the wrong compound was isolated?
