Procedure




Reaction carried out in two lots due to scale and volume of POCl3 required.
A
To MNR89-3 (3.95 g, 25.96 mmol) at room temperature was added POCl3 (24 mL, 259 mmol) under argon and the mixture was heated to reflux for 2 hours during which time the reaction turned a dark brown colour.  The the reaction was then allowed to reach room temperature and was slowly added dropwise to ice ice (400 mL) in a large beaker.  The mixture was then slowly neutralised with sodium bicarbonate.  A pale brown solid also began to precipitate out during the quencing.  Once the reaction was fully quenched it was extracted with EtOAc (400 mL x 2), the organics were combined and washed with brine (100 mL) then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give a pale orange solid.
B as above and quenched in the same ice bath, starting material (4.10 g, 26.9 mmol)
Column 40-80% EtOAc/Hex
Fracs 1-5 - 8.269 g, 48.5 mmol, 92% as a white crystaline solid
