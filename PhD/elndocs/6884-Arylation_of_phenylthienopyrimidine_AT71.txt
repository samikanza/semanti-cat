Arylation of phenylthienopyrimidine (AT-7-1)

Suzuki coupling of phenylthienopyrimidine AT-4a with PdCl2dppf.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.24 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-4a (0.025 g, 0.085 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.013 mg, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.012 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and filtered through Celite. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (6:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give a white solid (0.019 g, 76%).
