Arylation of chlorobromothienopyrimidine (AT-8-1)
7th March 2013 @ 05:06


Attempted arylation at the bromo-position of AT-5, using PdCl2dppf as catalyst. 


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (2 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.801 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-5 (0.050 g, 0.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.029 g, 0.24 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.029 g, 0.040 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (50 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (6:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give two compounds.

AT-8-1-top.pdf
 1H NMR spectrum of less polar compound, likely to be either AT-8a or AT-8b (0.007 g, 14% if AT-8a or 12% if AT-8b). LRMS says AT-8b.




AT-8-1-bottom.pdf
1H NMR spectrum of more polar compound, likely to be AT-8c (0.026 g, 75%).
