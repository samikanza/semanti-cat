Bromination of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-5-3)
5th March 2013 @ 04:44


Repeat of AT-5-2 on recovered starting material. 


To AT-5 (0.530 g, 3.11 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) recovered from AT-5-2 in THF (60 mL) at -78 C was added n-BuLi (0.186 mL, 4.66 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) dropwise and the reaction mixture stirred at -78 C for 30 minutes. Bromine (0.318 mL, 6.21 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture warmed to rt and stirred for 1 h. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (100 mL) and extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (7:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give the product AT-5 (0.302 g, 39%) and starting material AT-1 (0.079 g, 15%).
