Arylation of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-2-1)
20th February 2013 @ 04:23


Attempted arylation of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-1), ideally on the thiophene ring. Arylation could feasibly occur at the chloro-substituted centre. 
Procedure from Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1998, 71, 467 - 473. 


 
To palladium(II) acetate (0.003 g, 0.015 mmol, 0.05 equiv.), triphenylphosphine (0.008 g, 0.029 mmol, 0.10 equiv.), copper(I) iodide (0.112 g, 0.59 mmol, 2.0 equiv.), caesium carbonate (0.192 g, 0.59 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) under nitrogen were added AT-1 (0.050 g, 0.29 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.071 g, 0.59 mmol, 2.0 equiv.). DMF (2 mL) was added, the reaction mixture stirred at 140 C and the reaction monitored by TLC. 
TLC at 3 h showed no conversion of starting material. TLC (4:1 hexanes:dichloromethane) at 18 h revealed disappearance of starting material and a new (non-polar) compound. The reaction mixture was diluted with an aqueous solution of NaOH (1 M) and extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (4:1 hexanes:dichloromethane) to give the new compound as a white solid (0.007 mg). 
Analysis of this new compound by 1H NMR spectroscopy suggested that this compound was the bisphenyl product obtained from the homocoupling of the boronic acid. 
OOPS.


Further consultation of the literature revealed that the coupling partner should have been iodobenzene (rather than phenylboronic acid). Reaction to be repeated with the use of iodobenzene and brainpower.
