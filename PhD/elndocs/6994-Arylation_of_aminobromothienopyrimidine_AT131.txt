Suzuki coupling of 4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid to AT-6, using the conditions in AT-7-1.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.174 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.016 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.011 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled, diluted with methanol (10 mL) and filtered through Celite. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:45:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia) to give the product as a brown solid (0.021 g, 95%).
