A solution of AT-18-1 (0.030 g, 0.12 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 3-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.042 g, 0.15 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.018 g, 0.024 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes. 
Immediate colour change upon addition of catalyst to reaction mixture. Hydrazyl group doesn't like palladium?? 
Complex mixture of products observed by TLC. Reaction mixture not purified.
