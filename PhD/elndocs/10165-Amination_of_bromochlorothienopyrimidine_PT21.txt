Amination of bromochlorothienopyrimidine (AT-6-4) was repeated on 100 mg of substrate in 2ml of IPA and 4ml of ammonia at 120°C in a sealed tube for 3 hours. The solvents were removed in vacuo and the resulting orange solid was sufficiently pure to use as-is (B1, 102 mg, quantitative yield with 1eq ammonium chloride)
