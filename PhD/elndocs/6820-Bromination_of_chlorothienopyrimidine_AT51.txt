Bromination of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-5-1)

Bromination of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-1). Calculations for this procedure were generated using the "Analyze Stoichiometry" function in ChemDraw. 


 
To AT-1 (0.100 g, 0.58 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in THF (10 mL) at -78 C was added n-BuLi (0.256 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 0.64 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and bromine (0.060 mL, 1.17 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) added dropwise. The reaction mixture was warmed to rt with stirring and monitored by TLC. 
Reaction mixture turned dark brown after the addition of n-BuLi. Addition of bromine gave a bright orange reaction mixture. 
The reacton mixture was diluted with an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (20 mL) and extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (7:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give the product as an off-white solid (0.080 g, 55%).
