Procedure
To MNR89-1 (1.0 g, 6.57 mmol) at room temperature was added POCl3 (6.13 mL, 65.7 mmol) under argon and the mixture was heated to reflux for 90 minutes during which time the reaction turned a dark brown colour.  The the reaction was then allowed to reach room temperature and was cooled in an ice bath and slowly queched with some ice followed by saturated sodium bicarbonate solution.  During the quenching the mixture was transferred to a 500 mL conical flask due to volume of solution required.  A pale brown solid also began to precipitate out during the quencing.  Once the reaction was fully quenched (almost 500 mL aq required) it was extracted with EtOAc (200 mL x 2), the organics were combined and washed with brine (75 mL) then dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give a pale orange solid (1.196 g, 7.01 mmol, >100%)
