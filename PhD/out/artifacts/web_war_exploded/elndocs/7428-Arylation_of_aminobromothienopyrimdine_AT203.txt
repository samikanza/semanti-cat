Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimdine (AT-20-3)

Repeat of AT-20-2. 


 
A solution of AT-6 (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 3-(4'-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.052 g, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.019 g, 0.026 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (50 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia) to give the product (0.038 g, 82%) as a brown solid.
