1st May 2013 @ 02:02
Mnr: mnr121-130


Starting material from - Nucleophilic Displacement of MNR99 with Dimethylamine to give MNR122-1
As for - Bromination of MNR100-2 to give MNR101-2




Hazard Assessment
 
Procedure
MNR122-1 (1.8 g, 10.04 mmol) was dissolved in THF (200 mL) and cooled to -78 °C.  To the stirring solution was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 6.03 mL, 15.06 mmol) and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes.  Bromine (1.03 mL, 20.08 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred for 2 hours.  Sodium thiosulfate solution (100 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL).  The organic layers were commbined, dried and filteres then concentrated in vacuo to yield the crude as pale yellow solid.
