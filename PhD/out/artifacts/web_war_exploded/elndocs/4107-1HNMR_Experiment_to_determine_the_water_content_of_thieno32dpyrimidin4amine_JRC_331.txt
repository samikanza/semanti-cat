Amino-thienopyrimidine Series
Synthesis of the Amino-thienopyrimidine Series


1H-NMR Experiment to determine the water content of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (JRC 33-1)
17th August 2012 @ 02:57
It is suspected that the JRC 16-x series was thwarted by residual water locked in the crystal matrix of the relevant aminothienopyrimidine. This experiment is designed to test this hypothesis.

Crude thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine was recrystallised from 50% ethanol/water, and blown down gently with nitrogen, to yield off yellow hexagonal crystals (132.3 mg, 0.875 mmol).






Thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (96 mg, 0.63 mmol) was dissolved in deuterated DMSO and stirred at 40 °C over 3A mol. sieves for 1.25 hr.

NMR's show that a significant amount of water is removed by this reaction. The relative integrals need to be calculated.
