Mnr: MNR111-120


Starting material from Nucleophilic Displacement of 4-chlorothienopyrimidine with Piperazine MNR107-1 to give MNR113-1

Procedure
Crude MNR113-1 (0.370 g, 1.13 mmol) was dissolved in THF (23 mL) and cooled to -78 °C.  To the stirring solution was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 4.51 mL, 11.3 mmol) and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes.  Bromine (0.23 mL, 4.51 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred for 2 hours.
** I've used the wrong excel sheet and added way to much BuLi.  Error only noticed after the bromine was added.
 
Sodium thiosulfate solution (30 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 30 mL).  The organic layers were commbined, dried, filtered then concentrated in vacuo to yield the crude as a dark brown oil (0.735 g).  
 
TLC - 100% EtOAC - showed two new spots.  Most likely the the mono and di-bromo units.

Column
40-100% EtOAc/Hex


Fracs 9-30 - 0.102 g - not the di-bromo compound as expected.  Looks like product but not clean.
Fracs 31-43 - 0.112 g product but contained a lot of BuLi by-products
 
 
NMR


 
 
Conclusion


Traces of prodcut isolatted but very messy due the the wrong ammount of BuLi being used. The fractions containing product were taken onto the next step - Suzuki Coupling of MNR115 to give MNR116-1 and Suzuki Coupling of MNR115 to give MNR117-1 due to the submission deadline for the next round of screening.  The chances of these reactions working are small but worth the shot and it's the only material available.  






The reaction needs repeated using less BuLi as previously found and demonstrated.
