Amino-thienopyrimidine Series
Synthesis of the Amino-thienopyrimidine Series


JRC 43-1 coupling

This experiment is a last ditch effort to synthesise the desired product of the Suzuki reactions I've been performing. Here, a different catalyst is used. A slightly different substrate is also used. It is hoped that the bromine will selectively react with the boronic ester nucleophile in the Suzuki coupling.

1,4-Dioxane (6 mL) and water (4 mL) were degassed with nitrogen for 4 hr before 4-chloro-6-bromothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (142 mg, 0.57 mmol, 1 equiv.), cesium fluoride (399 mg, 2.62 mmol, 4.6 equiv.), sodium bicarbonate (200 mg, 2.38 mmol, 4.1 equiv.), 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (101.5 mg, 0.358 mmol, 0.7 equiv.) and 1,1'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene-palladium(II)dichloride (36 mg, 9 mol %) were added. The resultant red solution was heated to reflux under a blanket of argon for...
