Procedure
To MNR118-1 (0.180 g, 0.78 mmol) at room temperature was added POCl3 (0.73 mL, 7.79 mmol) under argon and the mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours during which time the reaction turned a dark brown colour.  The the reaction was then allowed to reach room temperature and was slowly added dropwise to ice (20 mL) in a beaker.  The mixture was then slowly neutralised with sodium bicarbonate.  Once the reaction was fully quenched it was filtered and washed with water to give a pale brown soild (0.086g)

Conclusion
NMR showed mainly starting material with less than 5% product.  The reaction has therefore started to go but has not had long enough.  Reaction needs repeated possibly at a higher temperature and for a longer period of time.
 
The new peaks in the 1H NMR at 9.17 and 8.80 are of different shifts to that of AT-5-6 (9.02 and 8.06) therefore suggesting that the Br substitution has occurred at the 7 position.
