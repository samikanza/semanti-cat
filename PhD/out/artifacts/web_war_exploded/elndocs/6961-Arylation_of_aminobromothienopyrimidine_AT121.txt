Suzuki coupling of AT-6 with benzyl boronic acid pinacol ester. 


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.174 mL, 0.17 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.87 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and boronic acid pinacol ester (0.23 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.). The reaction mixture was further degassed for 5 minutes, before PdCl2dppf (0.013 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and filtered through Celite. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia) to give three fractions. 
Fractions 6 - 10: 0.003 g
Fractions 11 - 30: 0.015 g
Fractions 31 - 51: 0.004 g

AT-12-1-f6-10.pdf
1H NMR spectrum of fractions 6-10. Contains aromatic protons. 




AT-12-1-f11-30.pdf
1H NMR spectrum of fractions 11-30. Possibly the desired product, though relatively insoluble in methanol-d4. 1H-COSY and 1H-NOESY indicates that the benzyl group has been coupled, with two distinct rotameric environments for the benzylic protons, with expected COSY and NOESY interactions. Or just a mixture of starting materials...




AT-12-1-f31-51.pdf
1H NMR spectrum of fractions 31-51. Likely to be the aminothienopyrimidine, i.e. loss of the bromo group.
