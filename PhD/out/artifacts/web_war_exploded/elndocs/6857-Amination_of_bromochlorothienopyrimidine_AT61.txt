Amination of bromochlorothienopyrimidine (AT-6-1)

Procedure taken from J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, 2689.


To AT-5 (0.050 g, 0.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) in a sealed tube was added a solution of NH3 (2 M in isopropanol, 10 mL) and the reaction mixture stirred at 95 C for 24 h. The reaction was cooled to temperature and solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia) to give starting material AT-5 (0.023 g, 46%) and product (0.022 g, 89% based on RSM).
