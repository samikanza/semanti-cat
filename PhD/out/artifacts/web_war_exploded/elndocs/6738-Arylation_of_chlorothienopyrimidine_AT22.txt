Arylation of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-2-2)
20th February 2013 @ 04:39


Attempted arylation of chlorothienopyrimidine (AT-1) under different conditions. Again, arylation at different sites is feasible. 
Procedure from Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 1473 - 1476. 


To AT-1 (0.050 g, 0.29 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.054 g, 0.44 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) under nitrogen was added palladium(II) acetate (0.003 g, 0.015 mmol, 0.05 equiv.). Acetic acid (0.2 mL) was added and the reaction vessel purged with nitrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under oxygen (1 atm) and monitored by TLC.
 
TLC at 3 h and 18 h showed no conversion of starting material. 
 
The reaction mixture was quenched with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (10 mL) and extracted into ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic phases were dried (MgSO4), concentrated under reduced pressure.
