Reaction Scheme:


Procedure:
0.400 g of bromochlorothienopyrimidine (0.8 mmol, 1 equiv) was added to 4 mL isopropanol and 8 mL ammonia, and stirred at 120oC in a sealed vessel for 3 hours. The solvents were removed under vacuum to give a yield of yellow-orange solid (222.5 mg, 0.967 mmol, 60.4 %) which was sufficiently pure to use as-is.
