Procedure
MNR100-1 (0.155 g, 0.7 mmol) was dissolved in THF (14 mL) and cooled to -78 °C.  To the stirring solution was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 2.8 mL, 7.0 mmol) and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes.  Bromine(0.14 mL, 2.8 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred for 2 hours.  Water (7 mL) and EtOAc (50 mL) was added followed by sodium thiosulfate solution.  The organic layer washed with water and brine and then concentrated in vacuo to yield an dark orange oil (238 mg).  This was then taken up in boiling 50% EtOH/water (18 mL) and left to stand overnight.  No crystal as such formed so the mixture was concentrated and ran through a column.
TLC in 50% EtOAc/Hex - 3 faint spots, none looking like a major product

Both NMRs full of BuLi by product, not clean and not looking very good with the mass recovered.
 
Conclusion




Looks like the excess BuLi has killed this reaction with very little, if any product, being formed and issolated.  This reaction should be repeated only using 1.1 eq of BuLi

Why the hell did you use so much BuLi? My lab book entries might not be great but there was never any indication that it would work with 10 eq.






Next time, do it with the right amount of BuLi and do the recryst with care. The orange crystals i got back last time were very nice indeed.






and your column was too quick. my thesis had the iodo variant eluted in a column starting with just hexane.

i take it back: i must have used that much buli by mistake when i did it, given that you followed my procedure. it still worked though when i did it, didn't it? maybe your recryst skills are the problem then.
