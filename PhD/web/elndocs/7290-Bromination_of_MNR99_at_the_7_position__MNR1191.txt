Mnr: MNR111-120


Attempted bromination of MNR99 at the 7 position rather than the 6 position. 
As for WO2011093684  (A2) ― 2011-08-04 - page 19 step 2

Procedure
MNR99-3 (0.30 g, 1.76 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (2 ml) (*2 mL was used to make up volume in the reaction tube).  Bromine (0.27 mL, 5.27 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred in a sealed tube at 120 °C for 14 hours.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, no precipitate had formed in the black reaction mixture.  The reaction mixture was transfered to a round bottomed flask ans rinsed with DCM (10 mL).  The mixture was distilled to remove the DCM then under reduced pressure to remove the acetic acid.  Ice was added to the resulting mixture and the solid was filtered off washing with water.
