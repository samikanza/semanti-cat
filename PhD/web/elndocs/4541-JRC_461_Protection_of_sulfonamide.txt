JRC 46-1 Protection of sulfonamide
24th September 2012 @ 05:52
This experiment aims to protect the sulfonamide, which I suspect is interfering in a Suzuki coupling, with a Boc group using Boc2O.






Lit: Neustadt (tet. lett.)


Conclusion: Desired product synthesised (40%).

3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan- 2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (141.5 mg, 0.500 mmol, 1 equiv.) and Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (103.1 mg, 0.472 mmol, 0.9 equiv.), DMAP (10.0 mg, 0.08 mmol, 16 mol %) and dried triethylamine (0.08 mL, 0.57 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) were stirred in dried dichloromethane (10 mL) for 24 hr. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and water (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (2 x 30 mL) and brine (20 mL) before being dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The residue was concentrated in vacuo to yield a colourless, viscous oil (119 mg). This residue was purified via flash chromatography using 100% EtOAc increasing to 10% MeOH/DCM as the eluent. Three fractions were eluted.






f1: 48 mg


f2: 29 mg


f3: 57 mg






Fractions 1 and 2 contained the desired product (77.0 mg, 0.20 mmol, 40%) as shown by 2D NMR.
