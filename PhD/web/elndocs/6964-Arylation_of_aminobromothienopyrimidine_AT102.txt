Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimidine (AT-10-2)
14th March 2013 @ 03:07


Repeat of the Suzuki coupling between AT-6 and arylboronic ester, using conditions from JRC50-2, with a modified solvent system of 1,4-dioxane/water (10:1).


To a degassed solution of 1,4-dioxane/water (10:1, 1 mL) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 4-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.027 g, 0.097 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and potassium acetate (0.034 g, 0.35 mmol, 4.0 equiv.). The reaction mixture was degassed for a further 5 minutes and PdCl2dppf (0.013 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at reflux overnight.
