Suzuki coupling of 4-fluorophenyl boronic acid to AT-6, using the conditions in AT-7-1.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.174 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and 4-fluorophenylboronic acid (0.015 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.011 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight.
