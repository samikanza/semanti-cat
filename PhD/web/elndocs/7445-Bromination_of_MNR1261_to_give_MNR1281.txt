Bromination of MNR126-1 to give MNR128-1
9th May 2013 @ 10:43
Mnr: mnr121-130


Starting material from - Nucleophilic Displacement of MNR99 with ethyl 1-piperazinecarboxylate to give MNR126-1
As for - Bromination of MNR100-2 to give MNR101-2




Hazard Assessment
 
Procedure
MNR126-1 (1.42 g, 4.86 mmol) was dissolved in THF (100 mL) and cooled to -78 °C.  To the stirring solution was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 2.91 mmol, 7.29 mmol) and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes.  Bromine (0.5 mL, 9.71 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred for 2 hours.  Sodium thiosulfate solution (100 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 100 mL).  The organic layers were commbined, dried and filteres then concentrated in vacuo to yield the crude as pale yellow solid.

Attempted purification of this reaction mixture by recrystallisation from EtOH. TLC and 1H NMR indicate several products that seem difficult to separate . I think something went wrong with the reaction (perhaps BuLi no good). Reaction mixture disposed...to be repeated.
