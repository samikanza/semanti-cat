Arylation of chlorobromothienopyrimidine (AT-26-1)
3rd May 2013 @ 02:42


Precursor to the sulfonamide with a hydrazyl (rather than amino) group on the pyrimidine ring. Reaction performed under higher dilution, lower catalyst loading and less boronic ester. 


 
To a solution of isopropanol (4 mL) and potassium carbonate (0.24 mL, 1 M, 0.24 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) degassed with argon was added AT-5 (0.030 g 0.12 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 4-sulfamoylphenyl boronic acid pinacol ester (0.037 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.0088 g, 0.012 mmol, 0.1 equiv.) and the reaction mixture heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes. 
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (50 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia).
