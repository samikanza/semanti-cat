Suzuki coupling of 4-(tert-butyl)phenyl boronic acid to AT-6, using the conditions in AT-7-1.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.174 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-6 (0.020 g, 0.087 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and 4-(tert-butyl)phenylboronic acid (0.019 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. PdCl2dppf (0.011 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and filtered through Celite. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:ammonia:methanol) to give the product as a brown solid (0.024 g, quant.).
