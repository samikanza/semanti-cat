Bromination of JRC58 to give MNR105-1
10th March 2013 @ 22:25
Mnr: MNR101-110


Starting material from JRC58-1 and JRC58-2 (no lab book report).  These were combined and comlumed to purify the sstarting material.  Column was not a great success due to the poor solubility of the product.  Further attempts at a better crystalisation method should be looked into for future attempts.  Synthesis of 4-thiomorpholinothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (JRC 58-1)

Procedure
JRC58  (0.04 g, 0.17 mmol) was dissolved in THF (4 mL) (very poor solublity, majority did not go into the solution) and cooled to -78 °C.  To the stirring solution was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 0.1 mL, 0.25 mmol) and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes.  Bromine (0.02 mL, 0.34 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and was stirred for 2 hours.  Sodium thiosulfate solution (30 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 10 mL).  The organic layers were commbined, dried and filteres then concentrated in vacuo to yield the crude.
