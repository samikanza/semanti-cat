Arylation of phenylthienopyrimidine (AT-7-2)

Suzuki coupling of phenylthienopyrimidine AT-4a with Pd-118.


To a degassed solution of isopropanol (1 mL) and aqueous potassium carbonate (1 M, 0.24 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was added AT-4a (0.025 g, 0.085 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and phenylboronic acid (0.013 g, 0.10 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and the reaction mixture further degassed for 5 minutes. Pd-118 (0.011 g, 0.017 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at 80 C overnight. 
The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with ethyl acetate (20 mL) and filtered through Celite. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (6:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) to give a white solid (0.019 g, 76%). 
Either PdCl2dppf (see AT-7-2) or Pd-118 can be used as catalyst for this transformation, with the product obtained in identical (according to these attempts) yield.
