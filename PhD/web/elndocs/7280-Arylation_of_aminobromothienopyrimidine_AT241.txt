Arylation of aminobromothienopyrimidine (AT-24-1)

A solution of AT-6 (0.030 g, 0.13 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 3-amidophenyl boronic acid (0.026 g, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and PdCl2dppf (0.019 g, 0.026 mmol, 0.2 equiv.) in isopropanol (2 mL) and K2CO3 (1 M, 0.26 mL, 0.26 mmol, 2.0 equiv.) was heated to 90 C in a microwave reactor (200 W) for 30 minutes.
The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol (10 mL), filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (95:4.5:0.5 dichloromethane:methanol:ammonia).
Based on NMR spectra, purification by triturating with methanol may be more successful. 
 
Isolated material (0.014 g, 40%). Some impure fractions were not collected, i.e. yield is higher than stated here.

AT-24-1-MeOD.pdf
Isolated compound in MeOD, not soluble! Impurity appears to be soluble, appears more abundant.




AT-24-1-MeOD-DMSO.pdf
Same NMR sample with the addition of a few drops of DMSO-d6 for solubility. Product is more soluble, peaks are stronger.
